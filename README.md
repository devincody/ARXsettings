## Welcome.

### Purpose
This project was developed specifically to assist in controlling a single 16-channel ARX board using Arduino.

The library abstracts away many complicated bit manipulations and allows the user to focus on operating the ARX board.

### Give me the code!

Download the repository as a .zip file by clicking the "Clone or Download" button.

If you don't have it already, download the Arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

Open the Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch>Include Library>Add .ZIP Library. Browse to your download location and select your file.

Follow the instructions on [this website](https://www.baldengineer.com/installing-arduino-library-from-github.html) if you still have quesitons.
### Overview

Broadly speaking, the methods are split into three categories. The first category is for configuring a single ARX channel. The second is for configuring all ARX channels simultaneously and the last category is the initialization and execution methods.

### Examples

Once the library is downloaded, you can find the examples in the Arduino IDE at:
